  description:
    "A property management platform for landlords to list rentals, manage tenants, collect payments, and streamline communication — built from the ground up to replace an old Wix site, that was meant to list properties to showcase them. This was turned from a property showcase, into a tool for landlords and tenants.",

  problem:
    "Managing 75+ tenants manually using spreadsheets and texts was error-prone and inefficient. Listings weren’t searchable, and payments were tracked offline on a spreadsheet that has been used for 10+ years.",
  solution:
    "The new platform provides automated rent tracking, digital lease uploads, property listings, and a secure admin dashboard — making rental management seamless.",
  features: [
    "Tenant and admin login with role-based access",
    "Automated rent balance tracking with Stripe",
    "Lease upload and document storage",
    "Maintenance request system",
    "Admin analytics dashboard (vacancy, rent collected, more)",
    "Mobile-friendly UI and listing preview system",
    "Tenant dashboard to view payments, submit maintenace requests, and much more",
    "Listed properties with pictures, descriptions, rent price, and applications for each (unoccupied) listing accepted through the website."
  ],
  impact:
    "Replaced manual management tools with a single integrated system. Saved hours of admin work weekly and modernized the tenant experience. Also relieved stress and less unneccessary interactions or phone calls with tenants.",
